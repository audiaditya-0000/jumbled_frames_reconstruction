# jumbled_frames_reconstruction
Provided with a 10 second 30 fps video whose frames have been randomly jumbled, my goal was to reconstruct the original video as accurately and efficiently as possible.
I have followed the approach of extracting the frames from the video and calculating the similarity matrix to find the similarity between each frame, which was then used to find the correct order of frames and reconstruct the original video.

27 October - Implemented solution, but processing took too long to complete 
28 October - Implemented multiprocessing, but video is reversed
